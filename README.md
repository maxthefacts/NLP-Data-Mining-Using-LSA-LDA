# NLP-Data-Mining-Using-LSA-LDA
Examining the public CFPB database of consumer fraud for topics and similarities

This project was performed at the behest of the New York State Office of the Attorney General Consumer Fraud Division.  The New York State Office of the Attorney General (OAG) is the branch of state government entrusted to regulate and enforce consumer protection statutes passed by the state legislature.  Current enforcement investigations begin with leads generated from written complaints submitted by the People of New York to the OAG.  These complaints primarily take two forms, written submissions and online submissions.  In either case, the person submitting the complaint must be savvy enough to know that the OAG is the right place to file the complaint, have access to resources to complies the required information to the complaint, and the confidence in the institutions of government to believe their complaint will be treated appropriately.  These de-facto requirements drastically limits and biases the complaints received by the OAG.

The OAG would like to expand its complaint database as well as the community complaining about fraud by identifying potential complaints being aired over social media, especially Twitter.  To do so, the OAG will need to data mine the extremely large number of tweets created by New Yorkers to identify potentially relevant fraudulent actors.  The CUSP team has developed a data mining approach that begins with publically available tweets and ends with labeled and sorted tweets available to OAG attorneys.
